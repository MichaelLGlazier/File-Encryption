# File-Encryption
This program encrypts a file passed to it via the command line using blowfish cbc mode and a passphrase
provided by the user after the program starts.
The program also takes other appropriate steps to secure data by limiting the core dump size, locking 
memory when handeling confidential data, and turning off echo to the terminal.
